	abstract = {In this paper, we study the research issues in realizing location recommendation services for large-scale location-based social networks, by exploiting the social and geographical characteristics of users and locations/places. Through our analysis on a dataset collected from Foursquare, a popular location-based social networking system, we observe that there exists strong social and geospatial ties among users and their favorite locations/places in the system. Accordingly, we develop a friend-based collaborative filtering (FCF) approach for location recommendation based on collaborative ratings of places made by social friends. Moreover, we propose a variant of FCF technique, namely Geo-Measured FCF (GM-FCF), based on heuristics derived from observed geospatial characteristics in the Foursquare dataset. Finally, the evaluation results show that the proposed family of FCF techniques holds comparable recommendation effectiveness against the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, while incurring significantly lower computational overhead. Meanwhile, the GM-FCF provides additional flexibility in tradeoff between recommendation effectiveness and computational overhead.},
